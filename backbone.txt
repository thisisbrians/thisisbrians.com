  - Possibly build framework that builds on Backbone.js?
      - Brainstem.js?
  - Read Backbone.js source.
  - Things that suck about Backbone.js (aka, things that it doesn't solve for you):
    - Templating
      - where do you put the templates? how do you organize (/name) them?
      - compiling?
    - Rendering
      - Re-rendering entire view when model(s) change(s) breaks nested views, decreases performance
      - Splitting up rendering into sub-methods duplicates pieces of template and logic from overall render
      - Typical rendering routine almost completely separates us from the DOM
        - sometimes on a model change, we just need to reach and and change one node of DOM
    - Nesting resources
      - Nested models and collections suck to implement
      - 'Bridge' was one pattern I came up with to decrease the suck, but not quite there yet
