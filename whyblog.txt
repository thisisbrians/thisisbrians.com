  Why write in the first place?
\*********************************************************************/

  - reasons not to
    - already a shitton of blogs, why add to the noise?
    - no one's going to read it anyway = waste of time.
    - time better spent working on more important shit.
    - not experts = nothing to add.

  - publish to put us under the microscope (eventually).
    - having to publish the post = social pressure to increase our own
      competence to avoid embarassment
    - our own expectations for ourselves increase when we know others
      are watching
    - get feedback on our ideas to validate if they are actually as 
      good as we think they are, and garner alternative
      perspectives/approaches to the problem or solution

  - write to make sure we think through ideas and don't take them for
    granted
    - don't think of starting a new piece as a commitment to ship—it
      isn't, nor should it be. think of it more as a new git branch to
      fuss around with a new idea on. experiment to see if it's
      actually any good. an open text editor is a much better incubator
      for that idea than writing it in a list or on a post-it somewhere
      - dustin curtis's blog platform idea lends itelf to this idea,
        with the 'ideas' versus 'published' distinction.
      - if some ramblings never see the light of day—then, great. that's more
        practice for next time.
    - don't waste creative juice. the moment when an idea is conceived
      is a moment when your brain is obviously working well, and the
      problems or implications related to that idea are fresh in your
      mind. go stream of consciousness on it for awhile and see where
      it takes you. the stream from a good idea (or even a bad one)
      could lead to a great idea. you won't know if you just jot down
      a sentence somewhere and move on.

  - write to reinforce what we know
    - the act of commiting something to ink (or html in this case) is
      that we must convince even ourselves that it's indeed true, or 
      at least what we believe. this lends itself to us having well
      reasoned opinions on issues that matter to us (we wouldn't be
      writing about them in the first place if they didn't matter.)
      musings of a didactice nature are even better—teach someone else,
      and you always teach yourself something as a byproduct.

  - how to get started
    - find a low friction way to develop your ideas in prose without
      having to publish them. start even without an intent to publish,
      because writing is good for you, anyway!
