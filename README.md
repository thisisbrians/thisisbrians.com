================

For now, this is just a couple of text files with ideas for blog posts, so named because I intend for it to eventually replace [thisisbrians.com](http://thisisbrians.com). I've been toying with the idea of blogging for quite awhile now, but haven't really found a blogging/writing tool that really fits my needs, so I decided to build it myself to see how it turns out.

What's different, in a nutshell, is that I want both public (blog) posts and private ones to arise out of the same writing process, and access to that process (minus the actual publishing part) and the resulting writings to not rely on me having Internet connectivity.
